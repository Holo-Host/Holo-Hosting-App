**Status:** Closed-Alpha. Early development and testing.

The hosting app is a space for Hosts and App Providers to interact

**App Providers** list their apps along with their hosting preferences. This makes the app available for hosting. It registers a domain name for the app and other stuff.

**Hosts** declare their intention to host an app and record their private signed service logs here. They can also compile invoices for their app Providers.

## How to test?

```
hc test | test/node_modules/faucet/bin/cmd.js
```
