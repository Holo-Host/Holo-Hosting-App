The hosting app is a space for Hosts and App Providers to interact

**App Providers** list their apps along with their hosting preferences. This makes the app available for hosting. It registers a domain name for the app and other stuff. (TODO)

**Hosts** declare their intention to host an app and record their private signed service logs here. They can also compile invoices for their app Providers.
